Our model's name is **YuE (乐)**. In Chinese, the word means "music" and "happiness." Some of you may find words that start with Yu hard to pronounce. If so, you can just call it "yeah." We wrote a song with our model's name.

YuE is a groundbreaking series of open-source foundation models designed for music generation, specifically for transforming lyrics into full songs (lyrics2song). It can generate a complete song, lasting several minutes, that includes both a catchy vocal track and complementary accompaniment, ensuring a polished and cohesive result. YuE is capable of modeling diverse genres/vocal styles. Below are examples of songs in the pop and metal genres. For more styles, please visit the demo page.

Pop:Quiet Evening

## YuE GP for the GPU Poor by DeepBeepMeep

Please first follow the instructions to install the app below.

### YuE versions

There are two versions of the YuE GP which each will download a different huggingspace model:

- Lyrics + Genre prompts (default) : the song will be generated based on the Lyrics and a genre's description
```bash
cd inference
python gradio_server.py
```

- In Context Learning (default), you can provide also audio prompts (either a mixed audio prompt or a vocal and instrumental prompt) to describe your expectations.
```bash
cd inference
python gradio_server.py --icl
```

### Performance profiles
You have access to numerous performance profiles depending on the performance of your GPU:\

To run the Gradio app with profile 1 (default profile, the fastest but requires 16 GB of VRAM):
```bash
cd inference
python gradio_server.py --profile 1
```

To run the Gradio app with profile 3 (default profile, a bit slower and the model is quantized to 8 bits but requires 12 GB of VRAM):
```bash
cd inference
python gradio_server.py --profile 3
```

To run the Gradio app with less than 10 GB of VRAM  profile 4 (very slow as this will incur sequencial offloading):
```bash
cd inference
python gradio_server.py --profile 4
```

If some reason the system seems to be frozen you may be short in VRAM and your GPU is swapping inefficiently data between the RAM and the VRAM. Something consuming even less VRAM makes it faster, it is why I have added a profile 5 which has the minimum possible VRAM consumption:
```bash
cd inference
python gradio_server.py --profile 5
```


If you have a Linux based system / Windows WSL or  were able to install Triton on Windows, you can also turn on Pytorch compilation with '--compile' for a faster generation.  
```bash
cd inference
python gradio_server.py --profile 4 --compile
```
To install Triton on Windows: https://github.com/woct0rdho/triton-windows/releases/download/v3.1.0-windows.post8/triton-3.1.0-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl

Likewise if you were not able to install flash attention on Windows, you can force the application to use sdpa attention instead by using the '--sdpa' switch. Be aware that this may requires more VRAM
```bash
cd inference
python gradio_server.py --profile 4 --sdpa
```

You can try a new experimental turbo stage 2 with profile 1 (16 GB+ RAM) that makes stage two times faster. However it is not clear whether this has some impact on the quality of the generated song:
```bash
cd inference
python gradio_server.py --profile 1 --turbo-stage2
```

You may check the mmgp git homepage  (https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/mmgp)  if you want to design your own profiles.

## News and Updates
* **2025.02.10 🔥**: V3.0 DeepBeepMeep: Added possibility to generate multiple songs per Genres prompt and to generate multiple Genres songs in a row based on the same lyrics. Added also a progression bar and an Abort button. You will need to update the transformers patch for the progression bar to work. I have also added an experimental turbo stage 2 that makes this stage two times faster (use the --turbo-stage2 switch). It will work with 16GB+ VRAM and may produce lesser quality songs.
* **2025.02.08 🔥**: V2.21 DeepBeepMeep: Thanks to olilanz for aligning infer.py with gradio server.py and addding code to reinforce robustness 
* **2025.02.06 🔥**: V2.2 DeepBeepMeep: forgot to remove test code that was slowing down profile 1 and 3
* **2025.02.06 🔥**: V2.1 DeepBeepMeep: 3 times faster with 12+ GB VRAM GPUs (requires Flash Attention 2) thanks to a new optimized transformers libary. You will need to reapply the patchtransformers.sh. Generating a 1 min song takes now only 4 minutes on a RTX 4090 ! Added also progression info in terminal to provide feedback (pending real progression bars).

* **2025.01.30 🔥**: V1.3 DeepBeepMeep: Added support for In Context Learning, now you can provide audio samples prompts to drive the song generation.

# Installation instructions


Python 3.10 is recommended as some issues have been reported on python 3.12 and 3.13. Python 3.11 might work as well. 

##  1) Install source code
Make sure you have git-lfs installed (https://git-lfs.com)

```
git lfs install
git clone https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/YuEGP/

cd YuEGP/inference/
git clone https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/xcodec_mini_infer
```

## 2) Install torch and requirements
Create a Venv or use Conda and Install torch 2.5.1 with Cuda 12.4 :
```
pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/test/cu124
```

Alternatively if you have an AMD GPU please do the following (many thanks to Hackey for sharing these install instructions): 
```
pip3 install torch torchaudio triton --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm6.2
TORCH_ROCM_AOTRITON_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL=1 python gradio_server.py --profile 1 --sdpa
```


Then install dependencies with the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3) (optional) Install FlashAttention
For saving GPU memory, **FlashAttention 2 is recommended**. Without it, large sequence lengths will lead to out-of-memory (OOM) errors, especially on GPUs with limited memory. Install it using the following command:
```
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

Before installing FlashAttention, ensure that your CUDA environment is correctly set up. 
For example, if you are using CUDA 12.4:
- If using a module system:
``` module load cuda12.4/toolkit/12.4.0 ```
- Or manually configure CUDA in your shell:

```
    export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.4/bin:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.4/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```


**As an alternative if you were unable to install Flash attention (usually a pain on Windows) you can use sdpa attention instead by adding the *--sdpa* switch when running the gradio server. However this may consume more VRAM.**


## 4) (optional) Transformers Patches for Low VRAM (< 10 GB of VRAM) and 2x faster genration with more than 16 GB of VRAM
If you have no choice but to use a low VRAM profile (profile 4 or profile 5), I am providing a patch for the transformers libray that should double the speed of the transformers libary (note this patch offers little little improvements on other profiles), this patch overwrites two files from the transformers libary. You can either copy and paste my 'transformers' folder in your venv or run the script below if the venv directory is just below the app directory:

Update: I have added another patch which double the speed of stage 2 of the generation process for all profiles and also triple the speed of stage 1 for profile 1 and 3 (16 GB VRAM +). You will need to install Flash Attention 2 for this second patch to work.

For Linux:
```
source patchtransformers.sh
```

For Windows:
```
patchtransformers.bat
```
## GPU Memory Usage and Sessions

Without the optimizations, YuE requires significant GPU memory for generating long sequences. 

If you have out of memory errors while a lot memory still seems to be free,  please try the following before lauching the app (many thanks to olilanz for this finding)  :  
```
export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True
```


Below are the recommended configurations:

- **For GPUs with 24GB memory or less**: Run **up to 2 sessions** concurrently to avoid out-of-memory (OOM) errors.
- **For full song generation** (many sessions, e.g., 4 or more): Use **GPUs with at least 80GB memory**. This can be achieved by combining multiple GPUs and enabling tensor parallelism.

To customize the number of sessions, the interface allows you to specify the desired session count. By default, the model runs **2 sessions** for optimal memory usage.

### Running the Script
Here’s a quick guide to help you generate music with **YuE** using 🤗 Transformers. Before running the code, make sure your environment is properly set up, and that all dependencies are installed.
In the following example, customize the `genres` and `lyrics` in the script, then execute it to generate a song with **YuE**.

Notice: Set `--run_n_segments` to the number of lyric sections if you want to generate a full song. Additionally, you can increase `--stage2_batch_size` based on your available GPU memory.

```bash
cd YuE/inference/
python infer.py \
    --stage1_model m-a-p/YuE-s1-7B-anneal-en-cot \
    --stage2_model m-a-p/YuE-s2-1B-general \
    --genre_txt prompt_examples/genre.txt \
    --lyrics_txt prompt_examples/lyrics.txt \
    --run_n_segments 2 \
    --stage2_batch_size 4 \
    --output_dir ./output \
    --cuda_idx 0 \
    --max_new_tokens 3000 
```

If you want to use audio prompt, enable `--use_audio_prompt`, and provide audio prompt:
```bash
cd YuE/inference/
python infer.py \
    --stage1_model m-a-p/YuE-s1-7B-anneal-en-icl \
    --stage2_model m-a-p/YuE-s2-1B-general \
    --genre_txt prompt_examples/genre.txt \
    --lyrics_txt prompt_examples/lyrics.txt \
    --run_n_segments 2 \
    --stage2_batch_size 4 \
    --output_dir ./output \
    --cuda_idx 0 \
    --max_new_tokens 3000 \
    --audio_prompt_path {YOUR_AUDIO_FILE} \
    --prompt_start_time 0 \
    --prompt_end_time 30 
```

### **Execution Time**
On an **H800 GPU**, generating 30s audio takes **150 seconds**.
On an **RTX 4090 GPU**, generating 30s audio takes approximately **360 seconds**.  

**Tips:**
1. `genres` should include details like instruments, genre, mood, vocal timbre, and vocal gender.
2. The length of `lyrics` segments and the `--max_new_tokens` value should be matched. For example, if `--max_new_tokens` is set to 3000, the maximum duration for a segment is around 30 seconds. Ensure your lyrics fit this time frame.
3. If using audio prompt，the duration around 30s will be fine.
---

### Notice
1. A suitable [Genre] tag consists of five components: genre, instrument, mood, gender, and timbre. All five should be included if possible, separated by spaces. The values of timbre should include "vocal" (e.g., "bright vocal").

2. Although our tags have an open vocabulary, we have provided the 200 most commonly used [tags](./wav_top_200_tags.json). It is recommended to select tags from this list for more stable results.

3. The order of the tags is flexible. For example, a stable genre control string might look like: "[Genre] inspiring female uplifting pop airy vocal electronic bright vocal vocal."

4. Additionally, we have introduced the "Mandarin" and "Cantonese" tags to distinguish between Mandarin and Cantonese, as their lyrics often share similarities.
